/**
  * Basic building block of a GUI tree.
  *
  * == Overview ==
  * A `TNode` is a fundamental building block of all content shown by a [[NodeGui]]. On its own, a `TNode` object will
  * not draw anything to the screen. Implementations must leverage interface functions to draw to the screen. Every `TNode`
  * has a few basic properties. More can be added during implementation as needed. For example, it may make sense for
  * some implementations to have a `size` property.
  *
  * == Positions ==
  * Every node has a position, defined by its `position` property. It defines a coordinate system that is originated at
  * the top-left corner of the node. Every child of this node has its own `position` property, that lives inside the
  * coordinate system of its parent.
  *
  * == Implementing ==
  * For create a custom implementation, there are several implementation overrides provided. These include events such
  * as mouse and keyboard events, as well as draw calls.
  *
